<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>There are four mailing lists relating to Xapian:</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt><a href="https://lists.xapian.org/mailman/listinfo/xapian-discuss">xapian-discuss</a></tt> for general discussions about the Xapian project
[<a href="http://gmane.org/info.php?group=gmane.comp.search.xapian.general">Gmane</a>]
<li> <tt><a href="https://lists.xapian.org/mailman/listinfo/xapian-devel">xapian-devel</a></tt> for technical discussions about the development of Xapian
[<a href="http://gmane.org/info.php?group=gmane.comp.search.xapian.devel">Gmane</a>]
<li> <tt><a href="https://lists.xapian.org/mailman/listinfo/xapian-commits">xapian-commits</a></tt> used to receive details of CVS/SVN commits (now inactive)
[<a href="http://gmane.org/info.php?group=gmane.comp.search.xapian.cvs">Gmane</a>]
<li> <tt><a href="https://lists.xapian.org/mailman/listinfo/xapian-tickets">xapian-tickets</a></tt> receives details of trac ticket changes (can be a <em>lot</em> of messages)
<!-- FIXME: need to subscribe tickets list to gmane...
[<a href="http://gmane.org/info.php?group=gmane.comp.search.xapian.cvs">Gmane</a>]
-->
</ul>

<p>The [Gmane] links take you to the Gmane news gateway which allows you to
read these lists with a newsreader, or browse the archives on the web.</p>

<p>Posts from non-subscribers currently require approval (we'd rather not
have to impose this restriction, but we also want to avoid relaying spam
to our subscribers).  So if you aren't subscribed, there's likely to be
a delay before your message is approved and relayed to the list.  Please
be patient and don't resend a message just because it doesn't appear right
away.
</p>

<p>
If you only want announcements, you can follow <a
href="https://twitter.com/xapian">@xapian on twitter</a>.

<h1>Matrix Chat</h1>

<p>Our Matrix room is #xapian:matrix.org, which is bridged to our IRC channel
so messages sent to either should be visible to both.
</p>

<p>
<a href"https://app.element.io/#/room/#xapian:matrix.org">Element</a> is a web
application which allows you to access the matrix room which is bridged to the
#xapian IRC channel.  Use requires registration (free), but the big advantage
is you stay in the room while disconnected, and then can catch up on the
discussion when you connect again.  There are also
<a href="https://element.io/get-started">mobile apps for Android and iOS and
desktop apps for various platforms</a>.
</p>

<h1>IRC</h1>

<p>We have an active IRC channel - #xapian on libera.chat (we're in the process of migrating off Freenode):</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/xapian">irc: link</a> if you have a desktop or mobile IRC client installed
<li> <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.libera.chat/#xapian">web interface</a> (OK for casual use, but you'll disconnect from IRC when you aren't online)
</ul>

<p>The users of the channel are in many different timezones, so you won't
necessarily get an instant response.  This doesn't mean we're ignoring you,
just that none of us are at our computers right now, so please hang on for a
reply, or use the mailing lists above if you're not able to stay online.
