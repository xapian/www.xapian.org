<p>
There are two different Perl bindings.  The original ones (Search::Xapian) are
hand-coded XS and the newer ones (Xapian) are generated using SWIG.  The big
advantage of the SWIG-generated bindings is that wrapping is more automated, so
newer API features are wrapped.  They aim to provide compatibility with the XS
bindings.
</p>

<p>Documentation is available on-line for both:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="Xapian.html">Perl Xapian module (newer SWIG-generated bindings)</a></li>
<li> <a href="Search/Xapian.html">Perl Search::Xapian module (older hand-coded XS bindings)</a></li>
